# Cubbles Documentation

This guide gives you a basic understanding of what cubbles are and how to build and use them in any arbitrary webapp.

__On top of the approach of web components__ (webcomponents.org) - the __Cubbles Platform__ provides a software infrastructure to support the whole lifecycle of a (web) component - from design to usage.

__Cubbles Components__ reside in a server-side repository (the __Cubbles Base__). At runtime each __Cubbles Component Instance (aka "cubble")__ provides a simple interface to be interoperable a) with each other and b) with the DOM-Api.

__Cubbles__ can act as
- a visual element of your applications user interface,
- a function block for (client-side) data processing and/or
- a connector to any (server-side) 3rd party data service.
