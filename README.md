# Cubbles Documentation

This guide gives you a basic understanding of what cubbles are and how to build and use them in any arbitrary webapp.

**On top of the approach of web components** \(webcomponents.org\) - the **Cubbles Platform** provides a software infrastructure to support the whole lifecycle of a \(web\) component - from design to usage.

**Cubbles Components** reside in a server-side repository \(the **Cubbles Base**\). At runtime each **Cubbles Component Instance \(aka "cubble"\)** provides a simple interface to be interoperable a\) with each other and b\) with the DOM-Api.

**Cubbles** can act as

* a visual element of your applications user interface,
* a function block for \(client-side\) data processing and/or
* a connector to any \(server-side\) 3rd party data service.

## Usage Scenarios

You can use Cubbles Components e.g. to:

* Visualize the latest business figures.
* Include search based information into any pages.
* Put the same contact formular on multiple pages \(of different webapplications\).
